# Anime Data Analysis

This project involves an in-depth analysis of anime data, focusing on various statistical methods to uncover trends and insights within the dataset.

## Overview

In this project, I explored random variables such as the number of episodes and ratings, utilizing:

- **Simple Probability**
- **Union Probability**
- **Intersection Probability**
- **Complementary Probability**
- **Difference in Probabilities**
- **Conditional Probability**
- **Bayesian Probabilities**
- **Creating New Variables**

I employed Probability Mass Functions (PMF), Probability Density Functions (PDF), and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF) to visualize and interpret the data, highlighting important patterns in the anime industry.

## Key Findings

- **Episode Distribution**: Identified prevalent formats, with peaks at 12 and 24 episodes, indicating common production patterns.
- **User Ratings**: Analyzed the rating distribution, revealing that most animes are well-received, with a concentration of scores between 7 and 8.5.
- **Genre Insights**: Evaluated correlations between demographics and genres, uncovering significant trends that shape audience preferences.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
